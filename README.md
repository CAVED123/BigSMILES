# \{:\)\} The BigSMILES/PolyDAT Project 

## What is BigSMILES/PolyDAT project?

The BigSMILES/PolyDAT project is an open-source effort that aims to lay down necessary infrastructure for polymer informatics. The goal of this project is to provide a series of standards and software that facilitate the communication between chemists, material scientists, cheminformatics researchers and computer scientists, and ultimately leading to more rapid development data-driven polymer research.

Currently, the project is comprised of three major components:

1. [**BigSMILES line notation**](https://olsenlabmit.github.io/BigSMILES/docs/line_notation.html)  
   an extension to the popular SMILES line notation that provides support over general polymeric and macromolecular systems
2. [**PolyDAT data schema**](#)  
   a data schema for reporting polymer characterization (paper, documentation and tutorials coming soon!)
3. **Open-source software**   
   associated with the line notation and data format. current tools include:
   * [BigSMILES Builder](https://olsenlabmit.github.io/BigSMILES_builder/): a graphical tool for constructing BigSMILES strings
      * [video tutorial](#)
   * [PolyDAT Data Form](https://olsenlabmit.github.io/PolyDAT-form/index.html): a form for generating BigSMILES data files
      * [video tutorial](#)
